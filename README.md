# Force Update Node Alias for Drupal 7

Pathauto doesn't allow admins to bulk override and generate URL aliases if the "generate" checkbox is unchecked or a URL alias didn't exist before.

This adds an operation for Views Bulk Operations and an option on the `admin/content` page to force generate/update a URL alias.
